                The dream of flying in the sky just like a bird is as old as human kind. You can make your dream come true with paragliding. This sport is considered to be risky, but the reality is that the safety of practitioners is quite high, especially compared to other adventure disciplines. Of course, you cannot paraglide unless you have undergone extensive training. There are numerous paragliding schools that you can select from. It is only natural for you to look for courses in your local area, but there are a number of other essential factors that you have to consider carefully as well.
                <br> <br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves towards the shore, particularly by means of a board. Surfing’s roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image and to win surfing some social respectability. Here is everything you need to know about surfing in India.

                <br> <br>
                Surf-worthy waves hit Indian shores all year round, averaging between three to five feet, however the season for large waves is from May to September. This is the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. At this point, the swells vary from eight to fifteen feet, with the largest waves rolling in almost always on the West Coast. Though there is a chance of storms and rain accompanying the swells, surfers often find the best breakers during these months.From October to April, the waters become gentler and also the waves retreat to normal. Occasionally, bigger swells are created on both the coasts by small storm systems. This is the small swell season (also the peak traveller season) and it’s the most effective time for beginners learn to surfing in India.
